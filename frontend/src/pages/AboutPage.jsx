      <h2>About Sun-Kissed & Southern</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Sun-Kissed & Southern</strong> — where the spirit of Florida lives in every stitch. 
        Born from our deep love for the Sunshine State, we celebrate everything that makes Florida feel like home:
        the sun on your skin, the sound of waves rolling in, and the down-home charm of southern living.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Our products are inspired by real Florida life — equal parts beach, country, and pure joy. Whether 
        you're rocking a laid-back tank top, a cozy sweatshirt for cool coastal nights, or a tumbler 
        filled with your favorite iced drink, everything we make is designed to spread sunshine and smiles.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe in porch swings and palm trees. In sunsets and saltwater. In kindness, comfort, 
        and showing up exactly as you are. Our goal is simple: to help you wear your Florida pride with 
        style and joy — wherever you are.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks for being here. Let’s keep it sun-kissed, always.
