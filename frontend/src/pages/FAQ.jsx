      <h4>Do you only ship to Florida?</h4>
      <p>Nope! We ship nationwide — but everything still feels like sunshine.</p>

      <h4>Are your shirts pre-shrunk?</h4>
      <p>Yep! Our tees are sun-tested, beach-approved, and tumble-wash safe.</p>

      <h4>Can I return something that didn’t fit?</h4>
      <p>Totally. Just send it back within 30 days. No sunscreen stains, please.</p>

      <h4>Do you offer wholesale?</h4>
      <p>We might! Reach out through the contact form and tell us what you have in mind.</p>
